 Tourism is a thriving industry that caters to a diverse range of travellers, each with unique preferences and constraints. With the advent of technology, there is a growing demand for personalized solutions for everything that streamline the travel planning process and offer tailored recommendations. In response to this need, our project focuses on the development of a tourism recommendation system that leverages user input to suggest suitable destinations within specified budgetary limits.
The primary aim of this project is to develop a tourism recommendation system that enhances the travel planning experience for users by offering personalized destination suggestions based on their preferences and budget constraints. To achieve this aim, the project is guided by the following objectives:

Designing an intuitive user interface: Develop a user-friendly interface using HTML and CSS to facilitate seamless interaction with the recommendation system.
Implementing backend functionality: Utilize PHP for server-side scripting to handle user requests, process data, and interact with the MySQL database.
Building a comprehensive database: Populate the database with a diverse range of travel destinations, including information on attractions, accommodations, and activities.
Personalizing recommendations: Employ data analysis techniques to analyze user preferences and budgetary constraints and generate personalized travel recommendations.
Enhancing user engagement: Incorporate features such as feedback submission, preference collection, and user authentication to enhance user interaction and satisfaction.
